    <p>Garlic chicken is a flavorful dish that combines tender pieces of chicken with the rich aroma of saut√©ed garlic. The chicken is usually marinated in a mix of garlic, soy sauce, and spices before being cooked to golden perfection, giving it a delicious balance of savory and slightly sweet taste.</p>
    <p>When cooked, the garlic caramelizes and creates a fragrant sauce that coats the chicken beautifully. This dish can be enjoyed with steamed rice, mashed potatoes, or vegetables, making it a simple yet satisfying meal for lunch or dinner.</p>
