    <p>Lasagna is a classic Italian dish made with layers of pasta sheets, rich tomato sauce, creamy béchamel, and melted cheese. It often includes seasoned ground meat such as beef or pork, giving it a hearty and savory flavor that makes it a comforting favorite around the world.</p>
    <p>The top layer is baked until golden and slightly crispy, while the inside remains soft and full of sauce and cheese. Each bite offers a mix of textures and flavors — cheesy, meaty, and perfectly seasoned. It’s often served hot with garlic bread or a fresh salad on the side.</p>
