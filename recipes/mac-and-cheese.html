        <li>Step 1:Heat oil in a saucepan over medium-high heat.
             Add onions and sauté for about 2 minutes. 
             Add celery and bell pepper, and
              continue to cook and stir until onions turn
               soft and translucent, 3 to 5 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>Step 2:Add butter, paprika, black pepper, 
            garlic powder, cumin, and salt, and sauté until butter is melted and spices are fragrant, 1 to 2 minutes. Stir in flour,
             and cook, stirring, for about 2 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>Step 3:Pour in cream and milk, and whisk
             thoroughly, incorporating any flour that is 
             stuck to the bottom of the pan. Bring sauce to 
             a simmer, whisking occasionally, then reduce 
             heat to medium-low;
             simmer for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally.

        </li>
        <li>Step 4:Turn off the heat, 
            and stir in 3/4 of both Cheddar and 
            Monterey Jack cheese. Move cheese sauce to the 
            back of the stove while you boil the pasta.</li>
        <li>Step 5:Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Step 6:Bring a large pot of salted 
            water to a boil, and cook bucatini for 30 s
            econds 
            less than directed on the package.</li>
        <li>Step 7:Drain well and transfer into a 
            9x13-inch casserole dish. Use tongs to
             quickly arrange pasta into an even layer.
              Ladle over cheese sauce, and use tongs to 
              move pasta around until it
             is evenly coated and uniformly distributed.</li>
        <li>Step 8:Top with remaining cheese.
             Sprinkle the top with cayenne pepper.</li>
        <li>Step 9:Bake in the preheated oven until 
            the top is golden brown and sauce is bubbling 
            around the edges, about 30 minutes.
             Let rest for 10 minutes before serving.</li>
